A2DVI Firmware Update README
============================

To update the firmware of an A2DVI card:

1. Switch off your Apple II. (It's otherwise safe to update the A2DVI card while it is still plugged in the Apple II.)
2. Press the white "BOOTSEL" button on top of the A2DVI's PICO module. Keep the button depressed.
3. While the button is still depressed, connect the USB cable between your PC/Mac and the PICO module.
4. Your PC/Mac should recognize a new mass storage drive.
5. Drag & drop the firmware file ("A2DVI_v...uf2" file) to the drive.
6. After 2 seconds the LED should light up. The firmware update is complete.
